programming:

  - title: Data Scientist at SINTEF Energy Research
    description: Using machine learning to predict the Nordic power markets. Meteorological, demographic and power-market data is cleaned, featured, and fed to models. We are using variants of LSTM. (A)

  - title: Lead developer at The Meteorological Institute of Norway
    description: Developed a new API called ODA (Observation Data Access), and its backend. The backend is programmed in golang and uses gRPC. It interfaces with distributed storage backends, cockroachdb and cassandra. Geohashes from google's s2geometry library were used as partition and cluster keys to accelerate geospatial searches. (B)

research:

  - item: SINTEF Energy Research - Researching the applicability of data driven approaches such as machine learning to predict Nordic power markets. The aim is to improve bidding for wind, hydro and solar, to make them more competitive in a deregulated market by optimizing trades over XBID.

  - item: The Norwegian Meteorological Institute - Researching the applicability of distributed databases for storing live weather data from IoT sensor networks. Used google's S2Geometry library to create geohashed partition keys.

  - item: "Four publications - two in Journal of High Energy Physics and two in
    Physical Review Letters."

  - item: "During my PhD I worked together with a team of highly competent researchers on the topic of integrability
    applied to gauge/gravity duality. Touches on string theory and Super Yang-Mills theory."

  - item: Participated in PhD schools in Canada, Italy, France, UK, Sweden and Denmark. Interacting with the wider theoretical physics community.
